This module acts as a middle layer between `@tscircuit/math-utils` and our codebase. If certain logic is missing from `@tscircuit/math-utils`, we define and implement custom logic here, with the intention of reintegrating it into the `math-utils` module later.

- `lib/maths/box`
re-exports existing data structures and function

- `lib/maths/random`
implements seed based random number generation using mulberry32
